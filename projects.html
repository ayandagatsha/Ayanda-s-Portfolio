            So, I'll take you through 3 of Ayanda's
              projects the encapsulate what he can do overall, since to go through the entire 
              list of projects he's done for years, is tiring and he's programmed me to have some of 
              his lazyness when I can afford to.
              </h4>

              <h4 class="terminal-text">The first project you can try out for yourself at the end 
                  of my explaination. The second, you can watch a short embedded youtube video of my demo 
                  of the app. For the third, you can keep the pdf of his effective workflow process.
              </h4>


              <h4 class="terminal-text">Ayanda learned effective use of code,
                  mongoDB, Mongoose and other technolgies to ensure when a user
                  writes an item to do, it stays even if the browser is shut down. 
                  Additionally, the web application can be accessed through different
                  devices and still hold the data the user input. It's also 
                  a responsive app, changing it's design to meet the suits of the 
                  device that has accessed it.

Ayanda learned the effective use of authentication, creating a note taking app 
, which he wanted to use to digitize his notes and keeping them secure. He opted
for non-third party authentication(Which he has set up though through google) 
due to the app being made for his use only. 
It's codebase will be necessary to serve as a template 
if he decides to make one for the public.

Ayanda learned design principles and utilizing frameworks when making use of the 3rd API he'd ever worked with.
